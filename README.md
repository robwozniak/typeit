# typeit.js
Simple JavaScript Typing Animation Plugin

## Setup development environment with docker
Usage purposes: You don't  (or you do not want to) have node and gulp installed globally on your machine.  

Required:  
- [docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) 
- [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)  

Run `$ docker-compose up` inside the project's root directory.  

## Test coverage  
There are available some basic unit tests which (more or less) cover some basic *typeit.js* functionality.  
Run `$yarn test` inside the project's root directory to start tests.
